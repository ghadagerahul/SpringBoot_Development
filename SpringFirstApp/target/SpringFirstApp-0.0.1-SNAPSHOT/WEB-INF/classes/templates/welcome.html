			Thanks Boris! Not the right place, but I have to rant now.. Why doesn't Eclipse give an option to delete the .lock file or even hint at its existence? What self-respecting IDE can't have multiple instances running in the same workspace anyway? If deleting the .lock file is the only solution, why doesn't Eclipse delete it upon start-up after checking that no other instances are running? Come to think of it, the .lock file would then become obsolete instantly! Lastly, other editors are in no way
